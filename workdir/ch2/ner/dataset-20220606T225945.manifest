{"source":"Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been striving to simplify IT infrastructure. Thanks to services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), AWS CloudFormation and many more, millions of customers can build reliable, scalable, and secure platforms in any AWS region in minutes. Having spent 10 years procuring, deploying and managing more hardware than I care to remember, I’m still amazed every day by the pace of innovation that builders achieve with our services."}
{"source":"With great power come great responsibility. The second you create AWS resources, you’re responsible for them: security of course, but also cost and scaling. This makes monitoring and alerting all the more important, which is why we built services like Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager."}
{"source":"Still, customers told us that their operations work would be much simpler if they could just look at a single dashboard, listing potential issues on AWS resources no matter which ones of their accounts or which region they’ve been created in."}
{"source":"We got to work, and today we’re very happy to announce the availability of AWS Systems Manager Explorer, a unified operations dashboard built as part of Systems Manager."}
